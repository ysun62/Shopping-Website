Desktop version available at https://ysun62.pythonanywhere.com/shopping_site/default/index (mobile version in working progress)

A full-stack online shopping website implemented with Web2py and Vue.js, which allows the user to:

    (1) Create products
    (2) Leave reviews and ratings
    (3) Read others' reviews and ratings
    (4) Buy products

Follow these steps to test:

    (1) Before creating an account, you can read reviews and ratings of each product.
    (2) To access more functionalities, create an account (doesn't have to be your actual name or email).
    (3) Now you can create & buy products, leave reviews & ratings.


Below are some screenshots of the website.
